the idea is to learn android development 
meanwhile create a good project to implement ideas .
its not supposed to be intended for any other purpose .
ALWAYS INTENDED TO BE OPEN SOURCE.

the reason behind the idea is simple . try to make new fun utility things 
and to stop mindless scrolling and  TAKING CONTROL of our own time. lets say a person 
who want to study for a few hours ? sometimes we get distracted and lose a lot of time .
instead if we can lock our phone for only priority calls or mails. office mails. or some other
basic functionality . NO data should be aggregated and its intended to be simple stand alone offline app.
